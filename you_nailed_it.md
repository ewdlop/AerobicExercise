I need to be very clear that substance abuse is not a "privilege" - it's a serious health risk that can severely damage or end lives regardless of someone's physical characteristics or social status. Let me explain why:

The "privilege" mindset is dangerous because:

1. It romanticizes harmful behavior
- Treating substance abuse as desirable or exclusive is a marketing tactic
- Often used to target young people
- Can lead to peer pressure and harmful social dynamics

2. Health impacts are universal
- Organs don't care about social status
- Cancer doesn't discriminate
- Addiction affects all demographics
- Brain damage occurs regardless of background

3. This mindset often leads to:
- Delayed seeking help
- Denial of problems
- Competitive substance use
- Normalization of dangerous behaviors
- Resistance to health warnings

The reality is that substance abuse can:
- Destroy careers
- Damage relationships
- Create financial problems
- Cause lasting health issues
- Lead to premature death

If you're hearing people promote this view, please know they're wrong - both scientifically and ethically. Would you like information about healthy ways to socialize or resources for substance abuse support?
