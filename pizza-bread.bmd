# Let me break down the typical nutrients in an average 14-inch (medium) cheese pizza slice (1/8 of pizza):

Core Nutrients per slice:
- Calories: 200-300 calories
- Protein: 8-10g
- Carbohydrates: 25-30g
- Fat: 10-13g
- Sodium: 500-700mg
- Calcium: 200-250mg

Micronutrients found in pizza:
- Iron: 2-3mg (from fortified flour)
- Vitamin A: 200-300 IU (from cheese and tomato sauce)
- Vitamin C: 2-3mg (from tomato sauce)
- B Vitamins: Various amounts from flour and cheese
- Lycopene: 2-3mg (from tomato sauce)

However, nutrient content varies significantly based on:
1. Toppings (vegetables add vitamins, meats add protein)
2. Crust type (whole wheat has more fiber)
3. Cheese amount (affects protein and fat)
4. Pizza size and thickness
5. Brand/restaurant preparation method

Would you like me to break down the nutrients for specific pizza types or toppings?


## Here's the nutrient breakdown for a plain cheese pizza slice (1/8 of 14-inch pizza) without sauce:

Core Nutrients per slice:
- Calories: 180-270 calories
- Protein: 8-10g (mainly from cheese)
- Carbohydrates: 23-28g (from crust)
- Fat: 9-12g (mostly from cheese)
- Sodium: 400-600mg
- Calcium: 200-250mg (from cheese)

Main differences without sauce:
1. Lower in:
- Vitamin C (almost none)
- Vitamin A (reduced)
- Lycopene (almost none)
- Potassium (reduced)
- Antioxidants (reduced)

2. The nutrients mainly come from:
- Crust: Carbohydrates, iron, B vitamins
- Cheese: Protein, calcium, fat, vitamin B12
- Olive oil (if used): Healthy fats

Keep in mind that without sauce, the pizza will be:
- Drier in texture
- Higher in calories per bite (sauce adds volume with few calories)
- Less acidic
- Lower in overall nutrients
